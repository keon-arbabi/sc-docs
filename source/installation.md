# Installation

brisc supports Linux, macOS, and Windows on Python 3.9+. Install it with conda or pip:

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} conda (recommended)
```bash
conda install -c conda-forge brisc
```
:::
:::{tab-item} pip
```bash
pip install brisc
```
:::
::::

conda is recommended because it sets up the fast MKL BLAS and some of the R packages brisc uses (both covered below); with pip you must handle those yourself.

## R packages

brisc's R integration is optional — you need it only for differential expression or for working with Seurat and SingleCellExperiment objects. Skip this section if you do neither.

It runs through [ryp](https://github.com/Wainberg/ryp), which bridges Python and R via R's arrow package, so arrow is always required. Each feature then adds one package: limma for differential expression, and Seurat or SingleCellExperiment for the corresponding objects.

conda handles this for you — `conda install -c conda-forge brisc` installs R, arrow, and Seurat. With pip you do it yourself: install R using [CRAN's per-platform instructions](https://cran.r-project.org), then run `install.packages(c("arrow", "Seurat"))` in an R session.

For differential expression, install limma:

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} conda (Linux/macOS)
```bash
conda install -c bioconda bioconductor-limma
```
:::
:::{tab-item} BiocManager (all platforms)
```bash
R -e 'if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) install.packages("BiocManager"); BiocManager::install("limma")'
```
:::
::::

For SingleCellExperiment data, install it:

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} conda (Linux/macOS)
```bash
conda install -c bioconda bioconductor-singlecellexperiment
```
:::
:::{tab-item} BiocManager (all platforms)
```bash
R -e 'if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) install.packages("BiocManager"); BiocManager::install("SingleCellExperiment")'
```
:::

## BLAS and threading

A few key steps — nearest-neighbor search, harmonization, and label transfer — rely on BLAS. On machines with x86 processors (most Linux and Windows machines), conda allows SciPy to be installed with **MKL BLAS**, which is highly optimized. (You can install this manually with `conda install "libblas=*=*mkl" scipy`, although installing brisc through conda takes care of this for you.)

However, pip's SciPy comes with **OpenBLAS**, which is less optimized and only supports up to 64 threads. To check which backend you have:

```python
import brisc
from threadpoolctl import threadpool_info
print(sorted({pool['internal_api'] for pool in threadpool_info()}))
```

`mkl` is the fast path; `openblas` means the 64-thread cap applies.
