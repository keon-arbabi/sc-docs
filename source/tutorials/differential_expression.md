# Differential Expression

This tutorial covers pseudobulk differential expression: summing each sample's counts across all cells of the same cell type, then testing genes for expression differences between conditions with [limma-voom](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gb-2014-15-2-r29). It uses the same ~10 million cell cytokine stimulation dataset as the other tutorials, comparing IFN-gamma-stimulated cells against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) controls within each cell type.

:::{note}
brisc runs differential expression through **limma**, an R package that isn't installed with brisc by default. Install it before running this tutorial — see [Installation → R packages](../installation.md#r-packages).

## Loading and quality control

The experiment spans several cytokines, but this analysis compares only IFN-gamma vs. PBS control, so we pass a `custom_filter` to `qc` that keeps just these cells and fails every other cytokine. As in the [basic workflow](basic_workflow.md), `qc` doesn't drop any cells — it records which ones passed in a `passed_QC` column.

`cast_obs(strict=False)` then recasts `cytokine` as a two-level Enum with `PBS` first, making PBS the reference that IFN-gamma is compared against. Every other cytokine, not in those two levels, becomes null — leaving just PBS and IFN-gamma.

```python
from brisc import SingleCell
import polars as pl

sc = SingleCell(
    'Parse_10M_PBMC_cytokines.h5ad',
    obs_columns=['sample', 'donor', 'cell_type', 'cytokine'])\
    .qc(custom_filter=pl.col('cytokine').is_in(['IFN-gamma', 'PBS']),
        allow_float=True)\
    .cast_obs({'cytokine': pl.Enum(['PBS', 'IFN-gamma'])}, strict=False)
```

## Pseudobulk aggregation

{meth}`~brisc.SingleCell.pseudobulk` sums each gene's raw counts across all cells from the same sample and cell type. Differential expression (DE) then runs on these per-sample gene expression profiles rather than on individual cells.

{class}`~brisc.Pseudobulk` datasets have three slots — {attr}`~brisc.Pseudobulk.X`, {attr}`~brisc.Pseudobulk.obs`, and {attr}`~brisc.Pseudobulk.var` — and each slot is a dictionary where the keys are cell types. For a given cell type, `X` is a samples × genes matrix of summed counts, `obs` is a DataFrame of sample-level metadata, and `var` is a DataFrame of gene-level metadata. `obs` has a `num_cells` column indicating how many cells went into each sample's pseudobulk. Whereas `var` retains all of the columns from the original SingleCell dataset, `obs` keeps only the ones that are the same for every cell within a sample, such as `donor` and `cytokine`.

```python
pb = sc.pseudobulk('sample', 'cell_type')
print(pb)
```
```none

    Memory, CD8 Naive, CD14 Mono, CD16 Mono, HSPC, ILC, MAIT, NK, NK CD56bright,
    NKT, Plasmablast, Treg, cDC, pDC
```

CD14 monocytes, for instance, have a 24 × 40,352 count matrix and one `obs` row per sample:

```python
print(pb.obs['CD14 Mono'].head())
```
```none

```

IFN-gamma samples have far fewer cells than PBS samples; the `log2(num_cells)` covariate accounts for this in the model.

:::{dropdown} Saving the pseudobulk
A pseudobulk dataset is a compact summary of the original SingleCell dataset, so saving it is a convenient way to re-run DE later without reloading the raw single-cell data. {meth}`~brisc.Pseudobulk.save` writes each cell type's `X`, `obs`, and `var` to a directory, and {meth}`Pseudobulk(directory) <brisc.Pseudobulk.__init__>` reads it back:

```python
# save to a directory, then reload without the raw single-cell data
pb.save('pseudobulk')

from brisc import Pseudobulk
pb = Pseudobulk('pseudobulk')

# save only certain cell types (or pass excluded_cell_types=)
pb.save('monocytes', cell_types=['CD14 Mono', 'CD16 Mono'])
```
:::

## Sample-level quality control

{meth}`~brisc.Pseudobulk.qc` runs independently for each cell type, filtering out low-quality samples, genes, and cell types. By default it keeps:

- **samples with ≥10 cells of that cell type**
- **non-outlier samples** — those whose zero-count gene total is less than 3 standard deviations above the mean
- **genes detected in ≥80% of samples**
- **cell types with ≥2 samples remaining** after applying the above three filters

Passing `cytokine` as the group column applies the gene-detection filter within each condition, keeping a gene only if it is detected in ≥80% of samples in both IFN-gamma and PBS. Without specifying a group column, that 80% threshold would instead be evaluated across all samples.

```python
pb = pb.qc('cytokine', verbose=True)
```
```none
[B Intermediate/Memory] Starting with 24 samples and 40,352 genes.
[B Intermediate/Memory] Filtering to samples with at least 10 B Intermediate/Memory cells...
[B Intermediate/Memory] 24 samples remain after filtering to samples with at least 10 B Intermediate/Memory cells.
[B Intermediate/Memory] Filtering to samples where the number of genes with 0 counts is <3 standard deviations above the mean...
[B Intermediate/Memory] 24 samples remain after filtering to samples where the number of genes with 0 counts is <3 standard deviations above the mean.

[B Intermediate/Memory] 14,696 genes remain after filtering to genes with at least one count in 80.0% of samples in each group.
...
[Plasmablast] Starting with 22 samples and 40,352 genes.
[Plasmablast] Filtering to samples with at least 10 Plasmablast cells...
[Plasmablast] 11 samples remain after filtering to samples with at least 10 Plasmablast cells.
[Plasmablast] Skipping this cell type because it has only 1 sample where group_column = 'IFN-gamma' after filtering, which is fewer than min_samples (2)
```

The number of genes kept varies by cell type, and a rare cell type can drop out entirely when a condition is left with too few samples. Here, Plasmablast is skipped because only one IFN-gamma sample has enough cells.

:::{dropdown} Customizing the filters
Each threshold is configurable:

```python
pb = pb.qc(
    'cytokine', min_cells=20, max_standard_deviations=2,
    min_nonzero_fraction=0.9, min_samples=3)
```

`min_cells`, `max_standard_deviations`,  `min_nonzero_fraction`, and `min_samples` are the four filters above; pass `None` to switch a filter off, or `min_nonzero_fraction=0` to drop only all-zero genes. Use `custom_filter` to adds an extra per-sample Boolean filter.
:::

## Differential expression

{meth}`~brisc.Pseudobulk.library_size` computes a TMM-normalized library size for each sample, and {meth}`~brisc.Pseudobulk.de` then fits a limma-voom model independently for each cell type. The model is written as an R formula. Each term is the name of a column in `obs`. brisc passes those columns to R's [`model.matrix`](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/model.matrix.html), which turns the formula into a design matrix.

How a column enters the matrix depends on its type. Numeric columns like `log2(num_cells)` go in unchanged. Categorical columns — here `cytokine` and `donor` — are split into *indicator* columns, each holding 1 for samples in its category and 0 otherwise. This is *treatment coding*: a column with N categories becomes N − 1 indicators, each named by joining the column and category with no separator, so `cytokine`'s `IFN-gamma` becomes `cytokineIFN-gamma`.

Treatment coding leaves one category out — the *reference* — which the model folds into the intercept. For `cytokine` that's `PBS`, the first level of the Enum we built while loading, so the design has a `cytokineIFN-gamma` column but no `cytokinePBS` column. This is exactly what we want: the `cytokineIFN-gamma` coefficient measures IFN-gamma relative to PBS. `de` reports the first non-intercept coefficient by default, so the call needs nothing but the formula:

```python
pb = pb.library_size()
de = pb.de(
    '~ cytokine + donor + log2(num_cells) + log2(library_size)',
    verbose=True)
```

```none

```

In the formula, `cytokine` is the effect of interest, `donor` accounts for the paired donors, and `log2(num_cells)` and `log2(library_size)` — recommended for every pseudobulk model — correct for the number of cells aggregated and for sequencing depth. Because the effect of interest is categorical, `de` fits voom's mean–variance trend separately within each condition ([voomByGroup](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10160736/)) by default.

`de` tests only the cell types that survived QC, so Plasmablast (dropped above) isn't among them. By default it also silently skips any surviving cell type it can't fit; pass `strict=True` to raise an error instead, or drop such cell types yourself with {meth}`~brisc.Pseudobulk.drop_cell_types`.

:::{dropdown} Other DE options
- `group=False` uses a single mean-variance trend (plain voom) rather than voomByGroup.
- `robust=True` makes the empirical Bayes step robust to outlier samples.
- `strict=True` errors on any cell type whose design matrix is rank-deficient or has too few samples to fit its coefficients — by default these cell types are silently skipped.
- `return_voom_info=False` skips storing the voom weights and plot data, for lower memory and runtime when you don't need them.
- `cell_types` and `excluded_cell_types` restrict testing to a subset of cell types.
- `ordinal_columns` treats a column as ordered rather than categorical, polynomial-coding it ([`contr.poly`](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/contrast.html)) into terms like `cytokine.L`.
- `formula`, `coefficient`, `contrasts`, and `group` can be dictionaries keyed by cell type, to allow different cell types to have different designs (e.g. when a covariate is present in only some cell types).

## Exploring the results

The results are collected in a {class}`~brisc.DE` object. Its methods summarize them, and the full per-gene table is `de.table`.

{meth}`~brisc.DE.get_num_hits` counts the significant genes (FDR < 0.05) in each cell type; cell types with no hits are omitted.

```python
print(de.get_num_hits())
```
```none

B cells and monocytes respond most strongly, as expected for IFN-gamma; the other tested cell types show no hits at this significance threshold.

{meth}`~brisc.DE.get_hits` returns the hits themselves; `num_top_hits` caps how many it reports per cell type. Each row is one gene in one cell type: `logFC` is the log2 fold change (the effect size), `SE` its standard error, `LCI`/`UCI` its 95% confidence interval, and `AveExpr` the gene's average expression in log CPM; `p`, `Bonferroni`, and `FDR` are the raw and corrected p-values, and `coefficient` names the tested effect.

```python
print(de.get_hits(num_top_hits=5))

Classic interferon-stimulated genes recur across cell types: `LAP3` is a top hit in three of the four, and `CD38` in both monocyte subsets — both are canonical interferon targets induced by IFN-gamma.

{meth}`~brisc.DE.plot_volcano` plots fold change against significance for one cell type. CD14 monocytes mount one of the strongest responses to IFN-gamma:

## Differential expression with complex designs

The default coefficient reports one comparison — a single condition against the baseline. A *contrast* tests any linear combination of the design-matrix columns instead: an average of several conditions, the difference between two of them, or a whole panel of comparisons at once. You write each as an expression in the `contrasts` argument, and `de` evaluates it.

The interferons are a good example. The dataset has 90 cytokines, and the four type I interferons — IFN-alpha1, IFN-beta, IFN-epsilon, IFN-omega — all signal through the IFNAR receptor, while IFN-gamma (type II) signals through IFNGR. How do their responses differ? That asks for the *average* of the four type I coefficients minus the IFN-gamma coefficient — a combination no single coefficient can give, and just what `contrasts` is for.

For those coefficients to exist, drop the intercept with `~ 0 + cytokine` so every interferon gets its own column. With an intercept, treatment coding leaves one level out as the reference, so it gets no column — and a contrast that names it fails with *"not the name of a column of the design matrix"*. Then name the comparison in the `contrasts` dictionary. brisc parses the expression itself, so the column names go in as written — backticked here only because the `-` in a name like `IFN-gamma` would otherwise read as subtraction:

```python
from brisc import SingleCell
import polars as pl

interferons = ['IFN-alpha1', 'IFN-beta', 'IFN-epsilon', 'IFN-omega', 'IFN-gamma']

sc = SingleCell(
    'Parse_10M_PBMC_cytokines.h5ad',
    obs_columns=['sample', 'donor', 'cell_type', 'cytokine'])\
    .qc(custom_filter=pl.col('cytokine').is_in(interferons),
        allow_float=True)

pb = sc.pseudobulk('sample', 'cell_type')\
    .qc('cytokine')\
    .library_size()

de = pb.de(
    '~ 0 + cytokine + donor + log2(num_cells) + log2(library_size)',
    contrasts={'type_I_vs_type_II':
        '(`cytokineIFN-alpha1` + `cytokineIFN-beta`'
        ' + `cytokineIFN-epsilon` + `cytokineIFN-omega`)/4'
        ' - `cytokineIFN-gamma`'})
```

The same form expresses any linear combination — one cytokine family against another, or several comparisons at once by adding more entries to the dictionary.

## Pipeline summary

The full differential expression pipeline:

```python
from brisc import SingleCell
import polars as pl

sc = SingleCell(
    'Parse_10M_PBMC_cytokines.h5ad', num_threads=-1,
    obs_columns=['sample', 'donor', 'cell_type', 'cytokine'])\
    .qc(custom_filter=pl.col('cytokine').is_in(['IFN-gamma', 'PBS']),
        allow_float=True)\
    .cast_obs({'cytokine': pl.Enum(['PBS', 'IFN-gamma'])}, strict=False)

pb = sc.pseudobulk('sample', 'cell_type')\
    .qc('cytokine')\
    .library_size()

de = pb.de('~ cytokine + donor + log2(num_cells) + log2(library_size)')

de.plot_volcano('CD14 Mono', 'volcano.png')
